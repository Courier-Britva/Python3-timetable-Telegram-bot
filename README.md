# I wrote this bot for Telegram, it helps the user to make a schedule.

Important. For the correct operation of the program you need to write in the terminal:
# pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
This command installs the library on your computer on which the bot runs.

You will also need a telegram bot token, which you can get from BotFather (I recommend reading more about this on the Internet).

The bot has a list of days of the week, each of which (from Monday to Sunday) can be edited separately.

At the touch of a button "Timetable" bot displays a list of days and things you have assigned to them

At the moment, unfortunately, I have not connected the SQL database to the bot, so the changes in the table will be visible to all users who have access to the bot.

This isn't exactly what I wanted, but on the other hand it's kind of fun
