# I wrote this bot for Telegram, it helps the user to make a schedule.

Important. For the correct operation of the program you need to write in the terminal:
# pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
This command installs the library on your computer on which the bot runs.

You will also need a telegram bot token, which you can get from BotFather (I recommend reading more about this on the Internet).

The bot has a list of days of the week, each of which (from Monday to Sunday) can be edited separately.

At the touch of a button "Timetable" bot displays a list of days and things you have assigned to them
